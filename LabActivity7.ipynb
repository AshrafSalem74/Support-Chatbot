    "European AI champion Mistral AI unveiled new large language models and formed an alliance with Microsoft. \n",
    "\n",
    "What’s new: Mistral AI introduced two closed models, Mistral Large and Mistral Small (joining Mistral Medium, which debuted quietly late last year). Microsoft invested $16.3 million in the French startup, and it agreed to distribute Mistral Large on its Azure platform and let Mistral AI use Azure computing infrastructure. Mistral AI makes the new models available to try for free here and to use on its La Plateforme and via custom deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model specs: The new models’ parameter counts, architectures, and training methods are undisclosed. Like the earlier, open source Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B, they can process 32,000 tokens of input context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mistral Large achieved 81.2 percent on the MMLU benchmark, outperforming Anthropic’s Claude 2, Google’s Gemini Pro, and Meta’s Llama 2 70B, though falling short of GPT-4. Mistral Small, which is optimized for latency and cost, achieved 72.2 percent on MMLU.\n",
    "Both models are fluent in French, German, Spanish, and Italian. They’re trained for function calling and JSON-format output.\n",
    "Microsoft’s investment in Mistral AI is significant but tiny compared to its $13 billion stake in OpenAI and Google and Amazon’s investments in Anthropic, which amount to $2 billion and $4 billion respectively.\n",
    "Mistral AI and Microsoft will collaborate to train bespoke models for customers including European governments.\n",
    "Behind the news: Mistral AI was founded in early 2023 by engineers from Google and Meta. The French government has touted the company as a home-grown competitor to U.S.-based leaders like OpenAI. France’s representatives in the European Commission argued on Mistral’s behalf to loosen the European Union’s AI Act oversight on powerful AI models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, but: Mistral AI’s partnership with Microsoft has divided European lawmakers and regulators. The European Commission, which already was investigating Microsoft’s agreement with OpenAI for potential breaches of antitrust law, plans to investigate the new partnership as well. Members of President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party criticized the deal’s potential to give a U.S. company access to European users’ data. However, other French lawmakers support the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why it matters: The partnership between Mistral AI and Microsoft gives the startup crucial processing power for training large models and greater access to potential customers around the world. It gives the tech giant greater access to the European market. And it gives Azure customers access to a high-performance model that’s tailored to Europe’s unique regulatory environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re thinking: Mistral AI has made impressive progress in a short time, especially relative to the resources at its disposal as a startup. Its partnership with a leading hyperscaler is a sign of the tremendous processing and distribution power that remains concentrated in the large, U.S.-headquartered cloud companies.\n",

      "# Report on Mistral AI and Microsoft Partnership\n",
      "\n",
      "## Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "European AI company Mistral AI has introduced two new large language models, Mistral Large and Mistral Small, and formed a strategic alliance with Microsoft. Microsoft invested $16.3 million in Mistral AI, agreeing to distribute Mistral Large on its Azure platform and provide Azure computing infrastructure to Mistral AI. The new models are available for free trials and can be used on Mistral AI's La Plateforme and via custom deployments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mistral Large achieved an impressive 81.2 percent on the MMLU benchmark, outperforming several competitors but falling short of GPT-4. Mistral Small, optimized for latency and cost, scored 72.2 percent. Both models support multiple languages and are trained for function calling and JSON-format output.\n",
      "\n",
      "The partnership aims to collaborate on training bespoke models for customers, including European governments. However, the deal has divided European lawmakers, with some criticizing potential data access by a U.S. company and others supporting the collaboration. The European Commission plans to investigate the partnership for potential antitrust law breaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Interesting Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q1: How does the investment from Microsoft compare to its investments in other AI companies?\n",
      "**A1:** Microsoft's $16.3 million investment in Mistral AI is relatively small compared to its $13 billion stake in OpenAI. Additionally, other tech giants like Google and Amazon have invested $2 billion and $4 billion respectively in Anthropic. This suggests that while significant, Microsoft's investment in Mistral AI is more modest and strategically targeted.\n",
      "<**$16.3 million is significantly smaller compared to Microsoft's $13 billion investment in OpenAI and the investments by Google and Amazon in Anthropic.**>\n",
      "\n",
      "### Q2: What are the potential regulatory challenges Mistral AI might face due to its partnership with Microsoft?\n",
      "**A2:** The partnership has already divided European lawmakers and regulators. The European Commission is investigating the deal for potential breaches of antitrust law. Members of President Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party have criticized the potential data access by a U.S. company, while other French lawmakers support the relationship. This indicates that Mistral AI might face scrutiny and regulatory challenges related to data privacy and antitrust issues.\n",
